## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
1. **Async complexity**: Carefully test race conditions
2. **Cache coherency**: Design clear invalidation strategy
3. **Error propagation**: Ensure errors don't get swallowed

### Process Risks
1. **Test coverage**: Start with critical paths
2. **Documentation lag**: Update docs with code
3. **Scope creep**: Stick to sprint goals
