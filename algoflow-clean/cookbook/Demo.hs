  putStrLn "- Graphs are just function composition with extra steps"
  putStrLn "- 'Graphs of graphs' = regular composition (no magic needed)"
  putStrLn "- FSMs are just graphs from (State, Input) to (State, Output)"
  putStrLn "- Category theory isn't arcane - it's just associative composition with identity"
