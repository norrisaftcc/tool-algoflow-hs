# Handoff Notes - AlgoFlow Project

## Session Summary
Date: 2025-08-03
Branch: fix/mcp-server-stderr-issue-20

### Work Completed
1. **Fixed all test compilation errors** - The test suite now compiles and runs successfully
   - Fixed CacheSpec ByteString vs Int type mismatch 
   - Fixed CoreSpec Arrow/Category instance errors (using Seq/Par constructors)
   - Fixed ExecuteSpec ExecutionError constructor issues
   - Fixed FreeSpec Text vs String and workflow type mismatches

2. **Test Suite Status**: 65/74 tests passing (9 failures)

### Key Discoveries
- `withCache` in Flow.Cache handles serialization internally - computations should return domain types, not ByteString
- Workflow types don't have Arrow/Category instances - must use explicit constructors (Seq, Par)
- ExecutionResult has 3 fields: value, duration, cacheHit
- Free monad workflows can't easily compose with bind - simplified tests to avoid complex monadic composition

### Current Test Failures (9)
1. **Cache hit counting** (2 failures):
   - CacheSpec: "updates access count on get" - expects 1, gets 0
   - CacheSpec: "tracks cache performance" - expects 3, gets 2

2. **ExecutionConfig defaults** (1 failure):
   - ExecuteSpec: enableCache defaults to True instead of False

3. **Error handling** (2 failures):
   - ExecuteSpec: Division by zero not caught properly
   - ExecuteSpec: Arithmetic error test crashes with uncaught exception

4. **Workflow computation** (4 failures):
   - FreeSpec: Complex workflow expects 52, gets 40
   - FreeSpec: dryRun output missing "parallel" (has "Parallel")
   - GraphSpec: Complex computation expects 55, gets 89
   - GraphSpec: Edge case error handling not throwing expected exception

### Next Steps (Priority Order)
1. Fix the 9 failing tests - most appear to be simple logic issues
2. Review current caching implementation (todo #2)
3. Re-enable Flow.Example module with proper types (todo #10)
4. Implement SQLite-based caching backend (todo #3)
5. Review and enhance error handling in Flow.Execute (todo #4)

### Technical Context
- Using GHC 9.6.7, Cabal build system
- Multiple workflow DSLs: Arrow-based, Free monad, Graph-based
- STM-based async execution engine
- Pluggable caching with in-memory implementation

### Commands for Next Session
```bash
cd algoflow-clean
cabal test                           # Run full test suite
cabal test --test-show-details=streaming  # See test output as it runs
cabal repl                          # Interactive development
```

Good luck with the next session! The project is in great shape with all compilation errors resolved.
