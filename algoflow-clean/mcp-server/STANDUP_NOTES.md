# Stand-Up Meeting Notes - MCP Server Testing

## Date: 2025-08-03

### Issue Identified
- **Problem**: Test harness (`test-node-server.mjs`) experiences JSON parsing errors
- **Root Cause**: Race condition where multiple MCP protocol messages arrive faster than they're processed, causing message concatenation in the buffer
- **Severity**: Low - only affects test harness, not actual MCP server operation

### Workaround Applied
```bash
# Run test with stderr redirected to avoid startup message interference
node test-node-server.mjs 2>/dev/null

# Or use the simpler test scripts that handle one operation at a time
node simple-test.mjs
```

### Proper Fix (Deferred)
The test harness needs better message boundary handling. Current implementation can fail when messages arrive in quick succession. The fix involves:
1. Proper stderr handling (already implemented)
2. More robust message parsing with better buffer management
3. Possibly adding small delays between test operations

### Action Items
- [ ] Continue with Sprint 1 priorities (caching, error handling, unit tests)
- [ ] Revisit test harness improvements in Sprint 2
- [ ] Document this as a known issue in test README

### Notes
- MCP server itself works correctly - issue is only in test harness
- Server properly separates stderr (debug) and stdout (protocol) 
- Can use Claude Desktop config as-is for real usage
