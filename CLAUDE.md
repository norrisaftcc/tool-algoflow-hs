# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is a Haskell-based workflow/computational graph engine that demonstrates clean, type-safe approaches to building workflow systems. The project contains two main implementations:

1. **AlgoFlow Clean** (`/algoflow-clean/`) - Comprehensive workflow engine with multiple DSL approaches
2. **Graph Runner** (`/algoflow-clean/v2/`) - Simplified ~150-line implementation focused on core concepts

## Build Commands

```bash
# Main project
cd algoflow-clean
cabal build              # Build the project
cabal run               # Run the main executable
cabal test              # Run tests (not yet implemented)

# V2 implementation
cd algoflow-clean/v2
cabal build             # Build the v2 project
cabal run demo          # Run the demo executable
```

## Development Commands

```bash
# Type checking and compilation
cabal build --ghc-options="-Wall"  # Build with all warnings

# REPL for interactive development
cabal repl              # Load modules in GHCi
cabal repl v2:demo      # Load v2 demo in GHCi

# Documentation
cabal haddock           # Generate Haddock documentation
```

## High-Level Architecture

### Core Design Principles
- **Type Safety First**: Uses GADTs, type families, and phantom types to make illegal states unrepresentable
- **Multiple Approaches**: Provides Arrow-based, Free monad, Graph-based, and Type-level implementations
- **Composability**: All components compose naturally using standard Haskell abstractions
- **Mathematical Correctness**: Implements proper Category and Arrow instances with law compliance

### Key Modules and Their Purpose

**Main Implementation (`/algoflow-clean/src/`)**:
- `Flow.Core.hs` - Arrow-based workflow abstraction using profunctors
- `Flow.Free.hs` - Free monad DSL for flexible, introspectable workflows
- `Flow.Graph.hs` - Graph representation using algebraic-graphs library
- `Flow.Typed.hs` - Type-level dependency checking at compile time
- `Flow.Execute.hs` - Asynchronous execution engine with parallel support
- `Flow.Cache.hs` - Caching interface (SQLite implementation planned)
- `Flow.Examples.hs` - Comprehensive usage examples

**V2 Implementation (`/algoflow-clean/v2/`)**:
- `Graph.hs` - Core computational graph abstraction in ~150 lines
- `Examples.hs` - Real-world usage patterns
- `Analysis.hs` - Static graph analysis capabilities
- `Verify.hs` - Category law verification

### Workflow Construction Patterns

The codebase supports multiple ways to construct workflows:

1. **Arrow Notation**: Using Haskell's arrow syntax for point-free composition
2. **Free Monad DSL**: Building workflows as data structures for interpretation
3. **Graph Construction**: Direct graph building with vertex and edge definitions
4. **Type-Level Programming**: Compile-time dependency validation

### Key Type Classes and Abstractions
- `WorkFlow` - Core workflow abstraction with dependency management
- `Cacheable` - Interface for cacheable computations
- `Flow` - Arrow-based workflow composition
- `Graph` - Computational graph representation

## Important Notes

- **No external linting tools configured** - Rely on GHC warnings (`-Wall` flag)
- **Tests not yet implemented** - Test framework (Hspec + QuickCheck) is configured but no tests written
- **Pure Cabal project** - No Stack configuration, use Cabal exclusively
- **GHC 9.4+ required** - Uses base ^>=4.17.0.0

## Common Development Tasks

When implementing new features:
1. Choose the appropriate abstraction (Arrow vs Free vs Graph)
2. Ensure type safety - prefer compile-time errors over runtime failures
3. Add examples to demonstrate usage
4. Use existing patterns from `Flow.Examples.hs` as reference
5. Maintain composability - new components should compose with existing ones

## Architectural Decisions

- **Why multiple approaches?** Different problem domains benefit from different abstractions
- **Why GADTs?** Type-safe workflow construction with compile-time guarantees
- **Why Free monads?** Introspectable workflows that can be analyzed before execution
- **Why algebraic-graphs?** Mathematical foundation for graph operations and analysis

## Learning Documentation

**IMPORTANT**: Update LESSONS.md with a "Stop and Jot" reflection at least once per pull request. Use the 3-2-1 format:
- 3 things you learned
- 2 highlights/interesting facts  
- 1 question you still have

This helps capture insights and learning throughout the development process. See LESSONS.md for the template and examples.

## Established Development Workflow

### 1. Project Organization
- **GitHub Issues**: All work is tracked through detailed GitHub issues with clear context and acceptance criteria
- **Umbrella Issues**: Complex features use umbrella issues with sub-task checkboxes
- **Labels**: Use descriptive labels (enhancement, documentation, testing, etc.)
- **Project Board**: Tasks organized in columns (Backlog â†’ In Progress â†’ Review â†’ Done)

### 2. Development Process
1. **Start with an Issue**: Every change should have a corresponding issue
2. **Create Feature Branch**: Use naming convention (feature/, fix/, docs/, etc.)
3. **Implement Changes**: Follow code style guidelines in CONTRIBUTING.md
4. **Update Tests**: Add/modify tests as needed (test suite in progress)
5. **Update Documentation**: Keep docs in sync with code changes
6. **Update LESSONS.md**: Add stop-and-jot reflection
7. **Submit PR**: Use PR template, reference issues

### 3. CI/CD Pipeline
- **Build Matrix**: Tests run on GHC 9.4, 9.6, 9.8 across Ubuntu, macOS, Windows
- **HLint**: Static analysis checks in CI
- **Documentation**: Auto-deployed to GitHub Pages on main branch
- **Test Suite**: Basic tests run (comprehensive suite in development)

### 4. Key Files Created
- `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/` - Bug, feature, and workflow example templates
- `.github/pull_request_template.md` - PR checklist including LESSONS.md
- `.github/workflows/ci.yml` - Main CI pipeline
- `.github/workflows/docs.yml` - Documentation deployment
- `.github/CODEOWNERS` - Code review assignments
- `CONTRIBUTING.md` - Development guidelines
- `LESSONS.md` - Learning documentation
