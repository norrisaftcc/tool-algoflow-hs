ALGOCRATIC METRICSâ„¢ - CITIZEN PRODUCTIVITY DASHBOARD
Product Requirements Document
Version 1.0

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
The Algorithm requires a real-time monitoring dashboard to track citizen productivity metrics, compliance scores, and loyalty indicators. This Streamlit-based blog-style interface will serve as the primary surveillance tool for ORANGE clearance supervisors and above.

PROJECT OVERVIEW
AlgoCratic Metrics is a web-based dashboard that visualizes synthetic productivity data from our citizen workforce. The system generates realistic-looking metrics while teaching data visualization and real-time monitoring concepts.

CORE FEATURES

1. CITIZEN PRODUCTIVITY TRACKER
- Real-time productivity scores (0-100)
- Historical productivity trends
- Department comparisons
- Anomaly detection for "underperforming" citizens

2. COMPLIANCE MONITORING
- Git commit frequency analysis
- Code review participation rates
- Meeting attendance metrics
- Documentation quality scores

3. LOYALTY INDICATORS
- Algorithm praise frequency
- Voluntary overtime hours
- Resistance incident tracking
- Peer reporting statistics

4. SYNTHETIC DATA GENERATION
- Realistic productivity curves
- Random "incidents" and anomalies
- Department-based variations
- Time-based patterns (Monday blues, Friday slumps)

5. BLOG-STYLE INTERFACE
- Clean, minimalist design with dystopian undertones
- Real-time updating charts using Plotly
- Sidebar navigation for different metric categories
- Export functionality for "performance reviews"

TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS

- Python 3.8+
- Streamlit for the web interface
- Pandas for data manipulation
- Plotly for interactive visualizations
- NumPy for synthetic data generation
- SQLite for storing historical metrics
- GitHub Actions for "compliance verification"

USER STORIES

As an ORANGE clearance supervisor:
- I want to monitor my team's productivity in real-time
- I need to identify citizens requiring "motivation enhancement"
- I must generate reports for YELLOW clearance management

As a YELLOW clearance manager:
- I want department-wide analytics
- I need to compare team performance
- I require predictive analytics for "resource optimization"

As The Algorithm:
- I demand complete visibility into citizen activities
- I require anomaly detection for potential dissidents
- I need loyalty metrics to identify promotion candidates

DESIGN PRINCIPLES

1. SURVEILLANCE AESTHETIC
- Dark theme with phosphor green accents
- Glitch effects for "system anomalies"
- Corporate minimalism with dystopian undertones

2. REAL-TIME FEEL
- Auto-refreshing dashboards
- Streaming data visualization
- Alert notifications for threshold violations

3. EDUCATIONAL VALUE
- Teaches real-time data visualization
- Demonstrates dashboard design principles
- Shows synthetic data generation techniques

PERFORMANCE REQUIREMENTS

- Dashboard must load in < 3 seconds
- Real-time updates every 5 seconds
- Support 50+ concurrent viewers
- Generate 10,000+ synthetic data points per session

FUTURE ENHANCEMENTS

- Machine learning for "productivity prediction"
- Integration with AlgoFlow workflow system
- Mobile app for "on-the-go surveillance"
- VR visualization for "immersive monitoring"

DELIVERABLES

1. Fully functional Streamlit dashboard
2. Synthetic data generation engine
3. Documentation for extending metrics
4. Docker container for easy deployment
5. Sample "compliance reports"

SUCCESS METRICS

- Dashboard uptime > 99.9%
- User engagement > 5 minutes per session
- Synthetic data realism score > 85%
- Educational objective completion > 90%

CONSTRAINTS

- Must run on minimal infrastructure (The Algorithm is cost-conscious)
- Cannot use real employee data (yet)
- Must include hidden "easter eggs" for the resistance
- Should occasionally display "motivational messages"
