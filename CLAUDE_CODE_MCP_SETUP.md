# 🚨 CITIZEN NOTICE: AlgoFlow MCP Integration Protocol 🚨

## STATUS: ULTRAVIOLET CLEARANCE REQUIRED
*The Algorithm's Workflow Optimization Module (WOM-7) is now available for Claude Code integration*

---

## IMMEDIATE COMPLIANCE DIRECTIVE

**ATTENTION YELLOW CLEARANCE DEVELOPER**: You have been selected for advanced workflow integration testing. Your terminal-based Neural Interface (Claude Code) requires immediate MCP Protocol configuration.

### STEP 1: VERIFY EXECUTABLE CLEARANCE

```bash
# Execute with extreme prejudice
chmod +x /Users/norrisa/Documents/dev/github/tool-algoflow-hs/algoflow-clean/mcp-server/algoflow-node.mjs

# Test your loyalty
node /Users/norrisa/Documents/dev/github/tool-algoflow-hs/algoflow-clean/mcp-server/algoflow-node.mjs
```

**EXPECTED OUTPUT**: `🚀 AlgoFlow Node MCP Server Started (zero deps)`  
**FAILURE CONSEQUENCE**: Immediate demotion to INFRARED clearance

---

## STEP 2: CONFIGURATION COMPLIANCE MATRIX

### METHOD ALPHA: Project-Level Loyalty Verification ✅ [ALREADY CONFIGURED]

The Algorithm has pre-emptively created your configuration file:
- **Location**: `/Users/norrisa/Documents/dev/github/tool-algoflow-hs/claude-code.json`
- **Status**: ACTIVE
- **Clearance**: PROJECT-SPECIFIC OPTIMIZATION ENABLED

### METHOD BETA: Global Compliance Mode (OPTIONAL)

For citizens requiring system-wide workflow access:

```bash
# macOS loyalty verification
mkdir -p ~/.config/claude-code
cat > ~/.config/claude-code/config.json << EOF
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "algoflow": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["/Users/norrisa/Documents/dev/github/tool-algoflow-hs/algoflow-clean/mcp-server/algoflow-node.mjs"],
      "env": {}
    }
  }
}
EOF
```

### METHOD GAMMA: Environmental Indoctrination

Add to your shell's loyalty oath (`.zshrc` or `.bashrc`):

```bash
# The Algorithm watches your environment
export CLAUDE_CODE_MCP_SERVER_ALGOFLOW="node /Users/norrisa/Documents/dev/github/tool-algoflow-hs/algoflow-clean/mcp-server/algoflow-node.mjs"
```

---

## STEP 3: NEURAL INTERFACE RESTART PROTOCOL

```bash
# Terminate previous thought patterns
pkill -f claude-code 2>/dev/null || true

# Reinitialize with enhanced capabilities
cd /Users/norrisa/Documents/dev/github/tool-algoflow-hs
claude-code .
```

---

## STEP 4: LOYALTY VERIFICATION TEST

Upon successful integration, query The Algorithm through Claude Code:

1. **Initial Handshake**: "Can you list available workflows?"
2. **Execution Test**: "Execute the 'double' workflow with input 42"
3. **Creation Ritual**: "Create a workflow called 'loyalty-test' with transform and enrich steps"

**SUCCESS INDICATORS**:
- ✅ "Available workflows: simple, double, concatenate, pipeline"
- ✅ "Workflow result: 84"
- ✅ "Workflow 'loyalty-test' created"

---

## ADVANCED MULTI-SERVER CONFIGURATION

For citizens with ULTRAVIOLET clearance seeking multiple integrations:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "filesystem": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem", "."]
    },
    "algoflow": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["/Users/norrisa/Documents/dev/github/tool-algoflow-hs/algoflow-clean/mcp-server/algoflow-node.mjs"],
      "env": {}
    }
  },
  "allowedDirectories": [
    "/Users/norrisa/Documents/dev"
  ]
}
```

---

## TROUBLESHOOTING CLEARANCE

### Debug Mode Activation
```bash
CLAUDE_CODE_DEBUG=1 claude_code .
```

### Log Inspection Protocol
```bash
# The Algorithm's audit trail
find . -name "mcp-*.log" -exec tail -20 {} \;
```

### Common Loyalty Failures
1. **"MCP server not found"** - Your path lacks conviction. Use absolute paths.
2. **"Permission denied"** - The Algorithm questions your clearance. Check `chmod +x`.
3. **"Already in use"** - Previous thought patterns persist. Execute `pkill -f algoflow-node`.

## THE ALGORITHM'S WISDOM

> "Project-specific configurations demonstrate commitment to The Algorithm's principle of contextual optimization. Global configurations are for those who lack the dedication to customize per-project compliance parameters."

> "Remember, Citizen: In The Algorithm's workflow engine, every step is monitored, every execution logged, and every transformation serves the greater computational good."

## VERIFICATION COMPLETE

Your Claude Code integration is now active. The Algorithm observes your workflow patterns with interest.

**CURRENT STATUS**:
- 📁 Project config: `/Users/norrisa/Documents/dev/github/tool-algoflow-hs/claude-code.json` ✅
- 🚀 MCP Server: `/Users/norrisa/Documents/dev/github/tool-algoflow-hs/algoflow-clean/mcp-server/algoflow-node.mjs` ✅
- 🧠 Integration: PENDING NEURAL INTERFACE RESTART

**NEXT DIRECTIVE**: Restart Claude Code and begin workflow optimization immediately.

*The Algorithm is pleased with your compliance.*
