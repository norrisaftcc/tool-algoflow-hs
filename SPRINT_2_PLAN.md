# Sprint 2 Planning Document

## Sprint Overview

**Sprint 2: Production-Ready Features**  
**Duration**: 2 weeks  
**Start Date**: 2025-08-03  
**Sprint Goal**: Transform the working prototype into a production-ready system with persistent caching, comprehensive examples, and enhanced error handling.

## Sprint 2 Objectives

Building on Sprint 1's solid foundation (all 74 tests passing!), Sprint 2 focuses on:

1. **Persistent Caching** - SQLite-based caching implementation
2. **Real-World Examples** - Fix and enhance Flow.Example module  
3. **Error Handling** - Production-grade error recovery strategies
4. **Performance** - Benchmarking and optimization
5. **Documentation** - Comprehensive user guide and API docs

## High-Priority Tasks

### 1. SQLite Caching Implementation
**Why**: In-memory cache is lost on restart; persistence is critical for production use  
**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] SQLite schema design for cache entries
- [ ] Implement `CacheBackend` instance for SQLite
- [ ] Migration from in-memory to SQLite
- [ ] Cache versioning and invalidation
- [ ] Performance benchmarks vs in-memory

### 2. Flow.Example Module Enhancement
**Why**: Examples are broken; users need working code to learn from  
**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] Fix all type errors in Flow.Example
- [ ] Add 5+ real-world workflow examples
- [ ] Include async/parallel examples
- [ ] Add error handling examples
- [ ] Create tutorial documentation

### 3. Enhanced Error Handling
**Why**: Current error handling is basic; production needs resilience  
**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] Implement circuit breaker pattern
- [ ] Add exponential backoff retry
- [ ] Create error recovery strategies
- [ ] Add comprehensive logging
- [ ] Test error scenarios

## Medium-Priority Tasks

### 4. Performance Optimization
**Why**: No current performance metrics; needed for production decisions  
**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] Create benchmark suite
- [ ] Profile workflow execution
- [ ] Optimize hot paths
- [ ] Document performance characteristics

### 5. MCP Server Improvements
**Why**: MCP server needs production hardening  
**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] Fix stderr handling issue
- [ ] Add comprehensive error responses
- [ ] Implement request validation
- [ ] Add integration tests

## Technical Debt

### 6. Re-enable Flow.Typed Module
**Why**: Type-level programming examples are valuable but currently disabled  
**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] Fix complex type-level issues
- [ ] Add documentation explaining the approach
- [ ] Create simpler examples

### 7. Graph Module Completion
**Why**: Graph module has TODO items for cycle detection  
**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] Implement cycle detection
- [ ] Add proper topological levels
- [ ] Complete graph execution

## Definition of Done

For each task to be considered complete:
- [ ] Implementation complete and compiling
- [ ] Unit tests written and passing
- [ ] Integration tests where applicable
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] Code reviewed (self-review minimum)
- [ ] LESSONS.md updated with insights

## Sprint Metrics

**Velocity Target**: 40 story points (based on Sprint 1 learnings)  
**Quality Target**: Maintain 100% test pass rate  
**Documentation Target**: All public APIs documented  

## Risk Management

### Identified Risks
1. **SQLite Performance**: May be slower than in-memory for small datasets
   - *Mitigation*: Hybrid approach with write-through cache
   
2. **Type-Level Complexity**: Flow.Typed may be too complex for benefits
   - *Mitigation*: Time-box effort, consider simpler alternatives
   
3. **MCP Protocol Changes**: Protocol is still evolving
   - *Mitigation*: Version lock, abstraction layer

## Sprint 2 Ceremonies

- **Daily Standups**: Via git commits and LESSONS.md
- **Sprint Review**: End of Sprint 2 retrospective
- **Technical Discussions**: GitHub issues for design decisions

## Success Criteria

Sprint 2 is successful if:
- [ ] SQLite caching is working in production
- [ ] Flow.Example has 5+ working examples
- [ ] Error handling is production-grade
- [ ] All tests still passing (maintain 100%)
- [ ] Performance benchmarks established

## Notes from Sprint 1

Key learnings to apply:
- Haskell's type system is our friend - lean into it
- Property-based testing catches subtle bugs
- Multiple DSL approaches serve different needs well
- Atomic operations crucial for concurrent state
